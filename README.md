# RNN and LSTM example notebooks

This project is part of the Machine Learning course of the Master in Data Science at the University of Sonora.

The repository contains two jupyter notebooks. The first one, nemd **Vanish_grad**, is related with the problem of gradient vanishing in recurrent neural networks (RNN). It addresses the contexts and ways in which this problem can arise. In addition, this problem is contrasted with the situations in which the exploiding gradient problem arises. 

In the second notebook, named **Hidden_states**, a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) RNN is described and developed. This is a neural network aimed at dealing with the aforementioned vanishing gradient problem. This notebook compares the operation and performance of a traditional RNN with that of an LSTM.
